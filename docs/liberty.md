###What s WebSphere Liberty?

IBM WebSphere® Liberty is a Java™ EE application server with a low-overhead Java runtime environment designed 
for cloud-native applications and microservices. WebSphere Liberty was created to be highly composable, start fast, 
use less memory, and scale easily. 

The [Total Economic Impact study](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-30750) from Forrester Research shows 
that Liberty can increase developer productivity, simplify administration and maximize infrastructure utilization.

The WebSphere Liberty architecture shares the same code base as the open sourced Open Liberty (link resides outside IBM) 
server runtime, which provides additional benefits such as low-cost experimentation, customization and seamless migration 
from open source to production.

###Modernize and Simplify with WebSphere Liberty in containers and cloud
Revolutionize the way you support your application estate. Reduce capital and operational costs, 
streamline security and simplify management¹. To get started, analyze your existing Java EE deployments 
with [IBM Transformation Advisor Local](http://ibm.biz/cloudta), a no-cost tool that identifies workloads that can 
easily move to Liberty in containers, and complex workloads that can move into VMs.

###Build new cloud native apps-using-ibm-transformation-advisor-and-cloud-pak
Use the latest Java EE 8 and MicroProfile APIs to build cloud-native apps and deploy them in Docker containers, 
on premises or in the cloud. Open Liberty gives developers the freedom to innovate and test with the option to 
deploy with IBM support with Liberty without rewriting any code.


WebSphere Liberty is built on the Open Liberty project that provides a 100% open source Java EE and MicroProfile core. 
The combination of IBM technology and open source software provides developers with access to the latest features.
