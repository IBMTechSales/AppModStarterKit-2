Modernization comes in many flavors. First, analyze your current application estate and prioritize your modernization goals. 

You can use IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor to analyze and categorize your applications. It provides guidance on the right 
target application server and the amount of effort that is required to start the modernization journey.

Several factors determine an application's path through the modernization phases and where it eventually finishes. 
Among those factors is the number of code changes that are required to move an application to a modern, cloud-ready
application server and the business need for future investment in the application. 

The outcome of the analysis can help you select appropriate modernization patterns.
