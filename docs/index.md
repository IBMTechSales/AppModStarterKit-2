Application Modernization begins with having a plan to understand your goals of app modernization, including modernization of the organization, people, and application inventory.  

This App Mod Starter kit is designed to help our Technical Sales teams and customers get started with the very important 
aspect of "assessing your applications" before you start modernizing the apps. 

The goal is to ensure you have the right processes and tools at your disposal to help customers plan and prioritize 
a modernization roadmap based on actual insights from the applications, using IBM Transformation Advisor. 

Before you get started... Here is some very practical advice from **Kyle Brown** - IBM Fellow, CTO Cloud Architecture, IBM Cloud Labs.

### Assess your application inventory before modernizing apps 

Before tackling the job of modernizing your applications, you need to assess your application inventory and how it 
aligns with business priorities. This will help you determine the best technical path to modernization and the effort 
and resources required. 

### App modernization = business modernization

By taking inventory of what you’ve got, especially tightly coupled monoliths that are hard to iterate, you can prepare 
your team accordingly and move away from the waterfall-based development methodology. This is an ongoing evaluation, 
not a one-time job. Aligning your approach with your overarching business priorities allows you to understand what 
needs are driving you to modernize. Though the risk of re-introducing risk into your portfolio may be high, thoroughly 
planning each step will ensure your modernization dollars are spent wisely.


### Classify your app portfolio

Once you’ve fully assessed your current portfolio, it’s time to classify your app portfolio and lay out the effort 
required to meet your outcomes. All apps are not created equal, so this step is crucial in understanding the time 
and resources that will be needed for each app and step of the process. The dependencies here are your code 
timeline and appetite for risk.


### Plan and prioritize

Ben Franklin once said, “If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.” I think it’s safe to say he wasn’t talking 
about modernization strategies, but his point is more than relevant here. If a plan isn’t designed around your 
unique business situation and bought into by all stakeholders, you are gambling with inviting the same amount of 
risk right back into your portfolio. Start with projects that can be quick wins and easily shoveled over, then 
move up your priority list.

It will be a balancing act—low priority projects are good learning vehicles, but might not drive as much 
business value. Starting with a quick win can be vital in reassuring your stakeholders and justifying 
investments for longer-term projects, whereas the longer, harder projects may result in a loss of confidence 
at the start. Dream big, but start small.
