This App Mod Starter kit is designed to help our Technical Sales teams and customers get started with the very important aspect of \"assessing your applications\" before you start modernizing the apps. The goal is to ensure you have the right processes and tools at your disposal to help customers plan and prioritize a modernization roadmap based on actual insights from the applications, using IBM Transformation Advisor. Before you get started... Here is some very practical advice from Kyle Brown - IBM Fellow, CTO Cloud Architecture, IBM Cloud Labs. App Modernization: Assess What you Possess Source: https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/app-modernization-inevitable Kyle Brown IBM Fellow, CTO Cloud Architecture, IBM Cloud Labs Assess your application inventory before modernizing apps Before tackling the job of modernizing your applications, you need to assess your application inventory and how it aligns with business priorities. This will help you determine the best technical path to modernization and the effort and resources required. App modernization = business modernization By taking inventory of what you\u2019ve got, especially tightly coupled monoliths that are hard to iterate, you can prepare your team accordingly and move away from the waterfall-based development methodology. This is an ongoing evaluation, not a one-time job. Aligning your approach with your overarching business priorities allows you to understand what needs are driving you to modernize. Though the risk of re-introducing risk into your portfolio may be high, thoroughly planning each step will ensure your modernization dollars are spent wisely. Classify your app portfolio Once you\u2019ve fully assessed your current portfolio, it\u2019s time to classify your app portfolio and lay out the effort required to meet your outcomes. All apps are not created equal, so this step is crucial in understanding the time and resources that will be needed for each app and step of the process. The dependencies here are your code timeline and appetite for risk. Plan and prioritize Ben Franklin once said, \u201cIf you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.\u201d I think it\u2019s safe to say he wasn\u2019t talking about modernization strategies, but his point is more than relevant here. If a plan isn\u2019t designed around your unique business situation and bought into by all stakeholders, you are gambling with inviting the same amount of risk right back into your portfolio. Start with projects that can be quick wins and easily shoveled over, then move up your priority list. It will be a balancing act\u2014low priority projects are good learning vehicles, but might not drive as much business value. Starting with a quick win can be vital in reassuring your stakeholders and justifying investments for longer-term projects, whereas the longer, harder projects may result in a loss of confidence at the start. Dream big, but start small.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#app-modernization-assess-what-you-possess","text":"Source: https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/app-modernization-inevitable Kyle Brown IBM Fellow, CTO Cloud Architecture, IBM Cloud Labs","title":"App Modernization: Assess What you Possess"},{"location":"#assess-your-application-inventory-before-modernizing-apps","text":"Before tackling the job of modernizing your applications, you need to assess your application inventory and how it aligns with business priorities.

First, analyze your current application estate and prioritize your modernization goals. You can use IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor to analyze and categorize your applications. It provides guidance on the right target application server and the amount of effort that is required to start the modernization journey. Several factors determine an application's path through the modernization phases and where it eventually finishes. Among those factors is the number of code changes that are required to move an application to a modern, cloud-ready application server and the business need for future investment in the application. The outcome of the analysis can help you select appropriate modernization patterns. 3.

Understanding the value of IBM Transformation Advisor 2 minutes Quick demonstration: How to use Transfomration Advisor to assess my WebSphere Applications See for yourself how IBM Transfromation Advisor is used to easily assess your existig WebSphere workloads and delivers insights into the feasabilty of modernizing the applications for containers and cloud. 7 minutes Quick demonstration: How to use IBM Transformation Advisor's migration plan to facilitate moving your application to containers and RedHat OpenShift Platform See for yourself how using IBM Transformation Advisor and its automatic generation of a migration bunlde can assist with containerization and deployment to RedHat OpenShift Platform. The migration bundle includes generated artifacts that assist with building, configuring, and deploying the application to WebShhere Liberty on the RedHat OpenShift Platform via integrated application stacks and pipelines with IBM Cloud Pak for Applications. 8 minutes Guided Tutorials 1. Application Modernization - Assessment Phase Gain valuable insights into applications during application modernization \"Assessment\" phase. Launch Tutorial: IBM Transformation Advisor - Application Assessment This tutorial focuses on the application assessment (evaluation) phase of application modernization for Java workloads to cotainer and cloud. You will use IBM Transformation Advisor to evaluate on-premises Java applications and identify a migration candidate for moving to the cloud. 2. Application Modernization - Re-Platform Phase Gain valuable insights into applications during application modernization \"Assessment\" phase. Launch Tutorial: IBM Transformation Advisor - Re-Platform IBM Transformation Advisor bridges the gap between existing development activities and cloud-native development together with the \u2018Accelerators for Teams\u2019 in the IBM Cloud Pak for Applications (ICPA). Transformation Advisor will accelerate the development process by creating the configuration and deployment artifacts for an application, then facilitate the developer\u2019s use of the enhanced developer productivity tools in IBM Cloud Pak for Applications. This tutorial brings the cloud-native development experience from the \u201cCreate and Deploy a Cloud Native App to IBM Cloud Pak for Applications (ICPA)\u201d lab, which develops a cloud native microservice application using the nodejs-express and java-spring-boot Application Stacks, to the modernization of existing application. 3.

IBM WebSphere\u00ae Liberty is a Java\u2122 EE application server with a low-overhead Java runtime environment designed for cloud-native applications and microservices. WebSphere Liberty was created to be highly composable, start fast, use less memory, and scale easily. The Total Economic Impact study from Forrester Research shows that Liberty can increase developer productivity, simplify administration and maximize infrastructure utilization. The WebSphere Liberty architecture shares the same code base as the open sourced Open Liberty (link resides outside IBM) server runtime, which provides additional benefits such as low-cost experimentation, customization and seamless migration from open source to production.
